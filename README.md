Prediction on Diabetes Patient’s Hospital Readmission Rates.
* Analyze the data and choose the best model for the training process (Machine Learning Algorithms, Python)
# Introduction
In this task, evaluated various machine learning models to predict readmissions of high-risk patients. preprocessed data using various techniques like feature encoding, feature scaling and we added some new features to our dataset. handled the class imbalance problem using synthetic minority oversampling technique. Then applied machine learning models Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and XGboost for prediction and achieved highest accuracy 94% using random forest. Then we implemented decision tree and random forest to detect top significant features, which contributes most to readmission of patients, Those features are Time in hospital, discharge disposition id, number of diagnosis, number of medication, age, number of procedures, gender,number of medication chanche ,and metformin.


# Methodology
-	Data Exploration and Analysis
-	Data Preprocessing
	•	Delete unnecessary features and records
	•	Feature Encoding
	•	Drugs Encoding
-	features Creation
-	Predictive Modelling

Now we will compare the performance of all previous models and choose the best model among them to solve the problem
